## Overview
This application allows a basic countdown timer to be started in a sequence with notifications of when a hooter should be sounded during the countdown, as regularly used for sailing races. The timer then begins to count up. As the approach uses websockets, it is possible to start multiple races and navigate to that race in seperatley, and see the current countdown/elapsed time.

## How to run
- Run the backend application with `go run main.go`
- Start the react dev server by running `npm start`
- Go to http://localhost:3000/
